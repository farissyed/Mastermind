Our project is split up into 3 different packages: game logic, player data, and user interface.  The game logic package contains classes focused on generating codes and determining feedback based on the user's guess.  The user interface package contains graphics code that creates the screen and displays the code details. This section handles events such as when the user is making their guess and displaying the feedback pins when the user submits their guess.
